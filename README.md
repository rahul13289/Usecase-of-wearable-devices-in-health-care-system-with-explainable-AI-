# Usecase-of-wearable-devices-in-health-care-system-with-explainable-AI-
The smart devices are used to predict health condition of the patient. The explainable AI was used to give aleart to patient and advising them to meet to doctor. The project was connected with iot device which was designed with gloves. 

INTRODUCTION:
We are going to analyse the data from wearable devices connected with healthcare system. The actual parameter are introduced such as age,cholesterol,heart rate,blood pressure,o2,temperature as a result we will be predicting whether the patient is on normal condition by evaluating the available dataset. 

The technology has an real time application of measuring medical parameters of a patient and making a justified report of him/her health condition on certain conditions because of this feature the doctors as well as care taker of the patient can monitor the health of patient constantly.

In this paper, we are measuring and analysing the sample data discharged from wearable devices for health care system. The data acquire parameters like age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen level of the patient by training and testing the prediction of normal condition of patient was founded. The supervised algorithm and unsupervised algorithm like logistic regression,knn,svm are implemented and accuracy are successfully probed for these algorithm. Best accuracy was found in knn algorithm with 94%.

Various explainable ai algorithm like shap,lime and explainable boosting machine are utilized. The performance of those algorithms and execution time of code are determined with plot.
